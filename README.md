# ATM Simulator

## Project Overview
This is a Java-based ATM simulator with a graphical user interface (GUI) built using Java Swing. The project simulates essential banking operations such as:
- **User Sign-Up**
- **User Login**
- **Balance Inquiry**
- **Withdrawals**
- **Deposits**
- **Mini Statement Generation**

The backend is powered by **MySQL**, which stores user data and transaction details securely.

## Features
1. **Sign-Up**: New users can create an account by filling out personal details.
2. **Login**: Existing users can log in using their card number and PIN.
3. **Withdrawals**: Users can withdraw money, with validation against available balance.
4. **Deposits**: Users can deposit money into their account.
5. **Balance Inquiry**: Users can check their current balance.
6. **Mini Statement**: Users can view their recent transactions.
7. **Error Handling**: Includes validation for sufficient balance during withdrawals and input fields.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: For the logic and GUI (Java Swing).
- **MySQL**: Database for storing user and transaction details.
- **JDBC**: For connecting Java to MySQL.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- MySQL Server and MySQL Workbench

### Steps
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/atm-simulator.git
   cd atm-simulator
2. Database Setup:

-> Import the provided SQL file (database.sql) in MySQL Workbench to create the necessary tables:
   signup, signuptwo, signupthree, login, bank
-> Update the Conn.java file with your MySQL username and password.


3. Running the Project:

   Compile and run the Java files. You can use your IDE (like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse) to build and run the project.

-> For command line:
   javac -d . *.java
   java bank.management.system.Login

Database Tables:
signup: Stores user registration details (name, fatherâ€™s name, address, etc.).
